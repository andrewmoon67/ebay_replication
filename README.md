# eBay Paid Search — Difference-in-Differences Replication
A reproducible replication package estimating the causal effect of eBay's
paid search advertising on revenue, based on the natural experiment analyzed
by Blake et al. (2014) and presented in Chapter 5 of Taddy (2019).
## Research Question
What is the effect of paid search (SEM) advertising on eBay's revenue?
## Data
The dataset (`input/PaidSearch.csv`) contains daily revenue observations for
210 designated market areas (DMAs) from April to July 2012. In 65 treatment
DMAs, eBay stopped bidding on Google AdWords on May 22, 2012. The remaining
145 DMAs serve as the control group.

## Repository Structure

|-- input/ # Raw data (never modified by code)
|-- code/ # Analysis scripts
| |-- preprocess.py # Data wrangling and figures

## Prerequisites
- Python 3 with `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- LaTeX (`pdflatex`) with `graphicx`, `booktabs`, and `amsmath` packages
## How to Reproduce
```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/ebay_replication.git
cd ebay_replication
bash run_all.sh
```
This will run the preprocessing, estimation, and paper compilation.
The final output is `paper/paper.pdf`.
## Results
The DID estimate suggests that turning off paid search reduced eBay revenue
by approximately 0.66% (gamma_hat = -0.0066 in log scale). However, the 95%
confidence interval [ -0.0175, 0.0043] includes zero, so the effect is not
statistically significant at the 5% level. This replicates the main finding
of Blake et al. (2014): paid search advertising has a small and statistically
insignificant effect on revenue for a well-known brand like eBay.
